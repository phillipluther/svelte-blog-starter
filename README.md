# phillipluther/svelte-play

The context and repo name seem self explanatory, but just in case … this is a git repository hosted on GitHub containing a collection of files that are the result of some guy named Phillip Luther goofballin' around with a JavaScript library called Svelte via SvelteKit, Svelte's kit for bootstrapping web applications.

…

Word on the street is that he (Phil) digs Svelte(Kit) so far.

# phillipluther/svelte-blog-template

A (deeply) personal blog starter using SvelteKit, which I find cool and fun to work with. Posts are written in markdown because of course they are.

It's intended to be a site + blog, actually, so blog post URLs include a `/blog` subfolder in the path.

## Motivation

I have big plans to write a lot of blog posts about a lot of things on myriad topics. Frankly â€¦ I probably won't; but I plan to! I'm hoping this project can be a jumping-off point to launch blogs and start writing and fuss less with tech stack and fuss more with content.
